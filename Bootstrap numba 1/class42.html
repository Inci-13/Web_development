    <!----------------Bootstrapppppp------------------------->
    <!-----------------Bootstrap is a framework of CSS and Javascript or we can say that it is an extention of them
    Which means the advance version of basic language which has more properties and functionalitys that normal CSS
    Lots of features like navigation bar, footer, slider, icons etc, can be created by using bootstrap only
    So this means bootstrap can be an alternate way to style our html. We can either use CSS or bootstrap. 
    Advantages of bootstrap:
    1.Websites created by bootstrap are responsive which means they fit on all devices without doing more coding
    if u do the same with CSS, then we have to use media query to make it responsive and do the coding 3 times for all devices. Hence, bootstrap saves time.

    2.Bootstrap creates much more professional websites

    3. We dont have to think what property we have to give and wether it will work or not like we do in CSS.
    Here there are fixed class names that we have to remember.
    Example:To create a navigation bar in bootstrap, we have 4-5 classes which we have to remember and give.

    4.Anyone with basic knowlegde of html and CSS can use bootstrap.It is compatible with all devices
    There are 2 ways to get connected to bootstrap.

    1. By copy pasting direct cloud links of bootstrap from official bootstrap websites in the head tag
    2. By downloading the bootstrap librarys and putting it in the project folder and then connecting it to the html file
